This directory contains the data files of the sounds recorded today

Additionally, in a folder 'signale', older recordings of the 'Glas' problem are made available.

You find two Matlab m-files, partially edited during this mornings lab. You may have to edit these m-files, as the flat 
organization of the files in the lab is a bit messy. If you move to subfodlers, change path names accordingly.
Also take care, the previous converter to interface to QuickCog was connif, which had changed to con2nif.

To convert to QuickCog, you have to make copy con2nif.p and .m into the work diorectory.

I suggest to create a folder Glasslab in the QuickCog nif-directory. A folder Glass of the data 
from the 'signale' folder is als enclosed and should be copied there.

ALso, all .ewp projects file should be copied to the QuickCog projects-directory.

The you should be able to view the feature space of raw data, possibly nmormailzed raw data with regard to starting point, and fft magnitude data of either source for all three examples.

After concluding these activities, try to generate spectrograms of your sound files and save them as bmp-files to be entered as pseudo-image examples in the QuickCog sample set editor.

Good luck !
